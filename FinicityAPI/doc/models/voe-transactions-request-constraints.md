# VOE Transactions Request Constraints

## Structure

`VOETransactionsRequestConstraints`

## Fields

| Name | Type | Tags | Description |
|  --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `reportId` | `string \| undefined` | Optional | The reportId of the original VOAI report or VOIE - Paystub (with TXVerify) report. This is an optional field and if included only the accounts from the report would be included in the VOE - Transactions report, otherwise all accounts for the consumer would be considered. |
| `accountIds` | `string \| undefined` | Optional | Specific accountIds to be included in the new report. This is an optional field if the client would like to constrain the report to specific accounts. |
| `incomeStreamConfidenceMinimum` | `number \| undefined` | Optional | Include income streams in the report, based on the income streamâ€™s confidence score. <br> <br> **Example**: If you pass in the value 50, then only income streams with a confidence score of 50 or higher are included. |
| `reportCustomFields` | [`ReportCustomField[] \| undefined`](../../doc/models/report-custom-field.md) | Optional | Designate up to 5 custom fields that you would like associated with the report upon generation by providing a label for the field and a value for the field. Set the shown variable to true if you want the custom field to display in the PDF reports. Set the shown variable to false to limit seeing the variable to JSON, XML report but not in the PDF report. All custom fields will display in the Reseller Billing endpoint.  This is optional. |
| `fromDate` | `bigint \| undefined` | Optional | The fromDate parameter is an Epoch Timestamp (in seconds), such as '1494449017'. Without this parameter, the report defaults to 61 days if available. Example: ?fromDate={fromDate}. If included, the epoch timestamp should be 10 digits long and be within twelve months of the present day. Extending the epoch timestamp beyond 10 digits will default back to twelve months of data. This query is optional. fromDate can also be passed as a query. |
